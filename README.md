# ProjetDataViz

As part of our last year of master, we worked on a data visualization project. We chose to work on the data consumption of Paris wifi hotspots. Here is the problem we wanted to answer:  

How to allow the municipality to better distribute its hotspots according to the data consumption and the density of the inhabitants ?  

To do this, we used a public government dataset. For the realization of the views we used d3.js. We then integrated our visualizations into a web template.
